# Google-Hashcode-2020
 This was the submission of our team of 2 people for the Google Hashcode 2020 hosted online.
 We scored a overal rank of #3897 and #4 in the nation.
 
 From what we can understand within the given 5 hours time frame of the competition, we had set the following aims.
 Objective:
    1. Store all the information (Books, Libraries and Days available) [Done]
    2. Store all the information about each book and each library [Done]
    3. Optimize in such a way that you can figure out, which books yield more score, which libraries have more books. [Done]
    4. Further Optimize (or rank) the libraries according to their sign up time. [Partially Done]
    5. Look for further optimizations which can make concurrent sign up of many libraries at once.[Somewhat done but solution is dumb]
    6. Further optimization according to test cases. [NOT DONE]
    
Takeaways:
   1. We should have been a little more prepared for the large sets of the data.
   2. We should have also experimented with randomization of the data, rather than just sorting.
   3. We should have tried a combination of (random+sort) on the data set. 
   4. Obviously, thought of better approaches, perhaps, graph or advance set theory.
